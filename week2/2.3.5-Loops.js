// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let score = 1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let total = 0;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while (score <= 100) {
total = total + score;
score++;
}
console.log(total);
// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100
for (let score=1; score<=100; score++){
  total = total + score;
};
console.log(total);
// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
